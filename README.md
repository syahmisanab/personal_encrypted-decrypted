The algorithm consists of the following main components:
1. **Base64 Decoding**: Decodes a base64-encoded password.
2. **Symbol Substitution**: Maps alphabetic characters to special symbols.
3. **Prime Shift Cipher**: Uses cyclic prime number shifts for character shifting.
4. **Password Validation**: Adjusts the algorithm based on the provided password.
